                            This website is created by a young develpoer, for the purpose of educating others on the
                            importance of keeping our planet safe and healthy.
                            <br>
                            The ideas and vision of the develpoer is to see change in attitudes of the audience
                            towards
                            doing
                            thingsto help improve our planet and promote positive feedback on issues relating to
                            climate
                            change.
                            <br>
                            Climate change website was first thought of and developed into an ideas by the developer
                            in
                            April
                            2023, and this brought about the creation on the website itself in June 2023.
                            The aim of the project is to see changes around the world on climate change related
                            issues
                            and hopes
                            to collaborate with other develpoers who might be interested in improving this website
                            to
                            suitable
                            standards.
                            The website will be running live from September 2023 with lots of improvement as time
                            passes.
                            Recommendation from freinds, family, sponspors and develpoers are highly welcome and
                            appreciated.

                        <P>
                            "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These
                            shifts may be natural, but since
                            the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due
                            to
                            the burning of fossil fuels
                            like coal, oil and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases.
                            Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped
                            around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures".
                            "The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and
                            methane. These come from using
                            gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land
                            and
                            cutting down forests can also
                            release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane
                            emissions. Energy, industry,
                            transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing
                            greenhouse
                            gases."<br>

                        <h2>HOW TO COMBACT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>

                        <h5>Generating Renewable Electricity</h5>
                        <p>
                            Generating Renewable Electricity would not only save you money, it will also
                            contribute to reducing the carbon emmissions of the world electricity network.
                            With millons of people already generating electricity from solar or wind, renewable
                            electricity
                            are quickly becoming more common across the world.
                            <br>
                            The types of renewable energy are solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectricity,
                            micro combined heat and power and many more which can be use to power home appliances,
                            electric vehicles and safe our plant from the massive effects of climate change.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Low Carbon Travel</h5>
                        <p>
                            "Shifting from cars to public transportation can reduce up to 2.2 tons of 
                             carbon emissions annually per individual".<br>

                             <br>
                              Biking and walking are also great way to reduce the level of carbon emmision on planets earth,
                              making simple life style changes can actually help save our world. simple lifestyel changes can indeed
                              save our planet.
                            </p>

                        <h5>Getting The Youngster Involve</h5>
                        <p> Activitely involving our youngster in the fight against cliamte change would mean that we are better prepared for the future.
                            Communicating the important of recyling, eating healthy food, taking public transport, walking, biking are some of the best way of informing our youngster. 
                            Sharing honest ideas and facts from trusted source and stating the effects of not doing things the right way will help them want to get involve.
