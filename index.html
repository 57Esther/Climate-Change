                            importance of keeping our planet safe and healthy.
                            <br>
                            The ideas and vision of the develpoer is to see change in attitudes of the audience

                            Climate change website was first thought of and developed into an ideas by the developer
                            in
                            April
                            2023, and this brought about the creation on the website itself in June 2023.
                            The aim of the project is to see changes around the world on climate change related
                            issues
                            and hopes
                            to collaborate with other develpoers who might be interested in improving this website
                            to
                            suitable

                            The website will be running live from September 2023 with lots of improvement as time
                            passes.

                        <P>
                            "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These
                            shifts may be natural, but since
                            the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due
                            to
                            the burning of fossil fuels
                            like coal, oil and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases.
                            Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped
                            around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures".
                            "The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and
                            methane. These come from using
                            gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land
                            and
                            cutting down forests can also
                            release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane
                            emissions. Energy, industry,
                            transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing
                            greenhouse
                            gases."<br>
