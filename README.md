 - #### Colour Scheme
   
   The colors used are primarily derived from the logo, the hero image, and other images in the website, to create a cohesive contrasting color scheme from beginning to end. I used [constrast grid.eightshapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to identify the three colors (in the middle) for background and images and add another two colors that fit well with the other three.  
   ![The color scheme](assets/readme-img/EightShapes-Contrast-color.png "The color scheme")

   - The website primarily uses a combination of vibrant colors, including grey and white to create an energetic and engaging visual experience.

   - #d6ffff
   - #41a323
   - #333
   - #ffffff
   - #33831b
   - A mixture of all the above colours were used throughout the site.
 



- ### Typograpy
     All of the fonts were sourced from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

- Main font: Lato.
    -  Lato is used as the main font, for all paragraphs,  
      and links in navbar and footer. lato was chosen because it has 
       modern, clean, and simple style, and following the recommendation in Google fonts of popular pairing font with 
       oswald.  

   -    Secondary font: Oswald. 
       Oswlad is used as the header font for the website. It was chosen first, since I wanted to choose a beautiful and impactful font for the heading inside the hero-image, since that is the first impression of the website from the user’s perspective. 

  -   Both Lato and Oswald were used as main and fallback font.
      Lato and Oswald are clean, modern  and vibrant font that adds to the overall aesthetic and readability of the content.
   
- ### Imagery

   These images were sourced from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com), and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).  
   * Hero Image is chosen because it’s blends with the tittle, so the heading text can stand out more, and it’s giving a clean and fresh feeling of living “climate change”.
   * All of the images in the website were taken from a free stock-photos website, as representations of what’s inside the shop, to provide clear imagery to the user and let the user know what to expect.

- ## Deployment

 -  The project was developed using Gitpod as the code editor, committed to Git as a local 
   repository, and finally pushed/ stored to GitHub. 
 
 - The website was originally created using code anywhere worspace 
    and dev tools, 
    due to lots of issues and bugs, and to meet up with the submission desadline I   was advised to download project files and open a new workspace using gitpod  which was used to complete and submit the project.

   - The website is deployed using GitHub Pages, which hosts the 
     project directly from the GitHub repository. Changes made to the repository are automatically reflected on the live site.

   - Getting into the habit of commenting when submitting any 
      changes to the site allowed me to better document the changes I made when creating the site. 
    - Using terminal to pull and push my repository.
