      ## Testing

         ### Validated the HTML and CSS code using W3C validators.
            Initially the site was recieving a lot of errors due to an outdated Font awesome link.
            I struggled with trying to import JS Font awesome, however managed to stick it through and get the issue resolved.

         ### Tested the website on various browsers and devices with various individuals.
           - Similar issue with Lighthouse. Lighthouse scores were poor, managed to score better when switching to incognito mode. Chrome extensions had an affect on website's performance score.

         ### Conducted user testing with friends and family members.
             Users enjoyed the sites visuals however later found out that the visuals were taking too much space and were too large. This resulted into compressing the image files which led to the decrease in some image quality.


    ## Deployment
         
         The website was originally created using code anywhere worspace and dev tools,

         The website is deployed using GitHub Pages, which hosts the project directly from the GitHub repository. Changes made to the repository are automatically reflected on the live site.

           Getting into the habit of commenting when submitting any changes to the site allowed me to better document the changes I made when creating the site. 
            Using terminal to pull and push my repository.
